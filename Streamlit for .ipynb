    "\n",
    "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create web applications for machine learning and data science. With Streamlit, you can quickly build interactive dashboards, prototypes, and data visualizations without dealing with the complexities of web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Streamlit offers a simple and intuitive API, allowing you to create powerful web apps with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "- **Fast prototyping**: Streamlit's rapid development cycle enables you to iterate quickly and test your ideas in real-time.\n",
    "- **Automatic updates**: Streamlit automatically updates the web app as you modify your code, providing instant feedback.\n",
    "- **Integration with data science libraries**: Streamlit seamlessly integrates with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow, making it easy to incorporate your data analysis and machine learning models.\n",
